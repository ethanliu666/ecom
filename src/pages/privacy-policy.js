          <p>
            The PnutPresets website may use “cookies” to help you personalize
            your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on
            your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run
            programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely
            assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain
            that issued the cookie to you.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
            feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
            server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if
            you personalize PnutPresets pages, or register with PnutPresets site
            or services, a cookie helps PnutPresets to recall your specific
            information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
            recording your personal information, such as billing addresses,
            shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same
            PnutPresets website, the information you previously provided can be
            retrieved, so you can easily use the PnutPresets features that you
            customized.

            You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
            automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your
            browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to
            decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the
            interactive features of the PnutPresets services or websites you
            visit.
